# JavaFX Image Converter Project

This is a simple JavaFX application that allows users to upload an image, convert it to grayscale, and save it back to their computer. 
It also provides the ability to display information about the process via a user-friendly interface, with additional 
features like hyperlinks and radio buttons.

## Features
- Upload an image file using a file chooser.
- Convert a color image to grayscale by averaging the RGB values of each pixel.
- Save the converted image to the local filesystem.
- Display additional information about the image conversion process.
- A user interface with:
  - Text fields for status updates.
  - A progress bar to show the progress of the image conversion.
  - Hyperlinks for more information.
  - Radio buttons to toggle the display of information about the project.
 
## Requirements
Java 8 or later (ensure that you are using a version of Java 
that includes JavaFX. If you are using a version that does not include JavaFX, 
you will need to install it separately from [here](https://openjfx.io/)).
