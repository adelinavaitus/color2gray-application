# JavaFX Image Converter Project

This is a simple JavaFX application that allows users to upload an image, convert it to grayscale, and save it back to their computer. 
It also provides the ability to display information about the process via a user-friendly interface, with additional 
features like hyperlinks and radio buttons.

## Testing the Application
You can test the application by downloading the Windows executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/adelinavaitus/color2gray-application/releases) section.
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/adelinavaitus/color2gray-application/releases) page.
2. Download the `Color2GrayApplication.exe` file from the latest release.
3. Ensure you have **Java 1.8 - 1.8.0_121** with **JavaFX** installed on your system.
